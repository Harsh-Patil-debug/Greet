const text=`Six months with you feels like a beautiful dream I never want to wake up from. From the very first day you came into my life, everything slowly started making more sense, like my world finally found its missing piece. In these six months, you’ve become my comfort on bad days, my happiness on good ones, and my reason to smile even on the most ordinary days. Every laugh we share, every little argument we fix together, every late-night talk, and every quiet moment has only made me fall deeper in love with you. You have this magical way of making my heart feel safe, full, and understood all at once. Loving you isn’t something I try to do—it comes so naturally, like breathing. You make me feel seen, valued, and cared for in ways I never knew I needed. With you, even the simplest moments turn special, and even the hardest days feel lighter because I know you’re by my side. These six months are not just time passed; they’re memories written into my heart forever. And if six months can feel this beautiful, I can’t even imagine how amazing forever with you will be. Thank you for being you, for loving me the way you do, and for choosing me every single day. I’m so incredibly blessed to have you in my life, and I promise to keep loving you more with every tomorrow. Happiest six months together, my love—this is just the beginning of our forever 💕✨`;

const page3Message=`She talks a lot, and I love listening to her. I fell for her the very first time I saw her, without even realizing how deeply I would fall—but here is the truth: I am in love. I had never been with anyone like her before. She is so pretty and cute. We don’t meet every day, but the craving to see her is so strong, like I want her every single second. When we are together, I don’t waste a moment admiring her.

I don’t know why, but I am completely obsessed with her. Sometimes I just think about what I did to deserve someone like her—how I got so lucky. I am truly so happy to have her in my life and feel incredibly blessed. The first time we met was on her birthday, 17th June. We matched by mistake, but that mistake turned into the best thing that ever happened to me. I am so scared to lose her. She means so much to me.

The first time I held her hand, I was totally lost in her beauty. It felt like the most beautiful thing that had ever happened to me. When she talks, the way her eyes speak, the way she laughs, and the way her hair moves with the air—I can’t take my eyes off her. She is so pretty that I can never fully describe her in words. I am so happy with her and prayed to be with her forever.

The first time I saw her in a bindi, she looked unbelievably beautiful. I couldn’t understand how someone could look so perfect. I crave her the most. I have never craved someone like this before. If anyone ever asks me who she is to me, I would happily say she is my home. I feel safe with her.

I got attached to her so quickly. The first time we hugged, the height difference made it even more special. I swear to God, I love her so much—I don’t have words to describe how good and perfect it feels. Our first date was on 27th October, with a little twist—we ordered pizza online and enjoyed it so much. On 31st October, we met again at VRR Patil, after a long time. I don’t know why, but every meeting feels better than the last. It always brings us closer.

She gifted me a bracelet and a chain—the prettiest things I could ever have. They are so pyaara , and she herself is even more pyara . I can’t describe how cute she is. Once again, I don’t know what I did to deserve her, but I know this—I am truly blessed.
This time, I’m never going to give up on you. I will love you the way you are, even when you can’t love yourself. I don’t want you to act mature all the time—I want you to be real. I want to see that little kid inside you always. I will keep you the happiest I possibly can. I know I don’t always look perfect, and sometimes I get scared that you might leave, but I’m loving you more than I ever thought I could. I’m trying my best every single day just to keep you happy. I don’t want to be with anyone else but you, because the way you understand me—no one ever could.

People might say this doesn’t feel real, that it’s just timepass, and ask who will truly stay and who will leave. But I believe this chance we have can turn into something real. I want to try more than anything. I love you deeply, more than you know, and I remember every little thing you do. Every small habit, every tiny moment—you are always on my mind, my bbg.

Our first date was on 6th November, and it felt so special. Even though it was short and we couldn’t go far, like Mumbai, because of time limits, we still enjoyed it so much—more than we ever expected. Every moment with you feels precious.

I remember reaching the Gateway and clicking pictures together for the first time. We spent time at Marine Drive, sitting there, talking, laughing, and the way your hair, eyes, and smile looked—it made me lose myself completely. I kept thinking how someone could be so perfect. You looked so cute and beautiful that day. I showed you my diary, and when you read it, you didn’t fully understand everything, yet you still loved it. Watching your reaction was so adorable that I secretly recorded that moment—it was too precious to lose.

Time passed so quickly that day. Before we knew it, it was time to leave. Those five hours felt like five minutes with you. On the train, we were both sleepy, completely tired, but happy. When we hugged before leaving and went back home, I knew I would never forget that day. No matter how much someone tries to make me forget you, my heart will always choose you.

I remember you practicing, watching you play, and cheering for you every day. On 16th November, I was so proud seeing you lead your team and reach the finals. Even though you didn’t win, the way you played, the way you tried—it made me want to hug you so tight. Seeing your crossed fingers, your prayers, and your hope made everything feel possible. You did so well, and I felt incredibly blessed to have you in my life.

Being with you feels like home. The time we spend together is the best part of my life—when I’m with you, all my problems disappear. I love you so much, my bbg. I promise to love you in a way that you’ll never doubt my love. I’ll keep you forever, protect you forever, and make you the happiest—because you are my home, my peace, and my everything.`;
